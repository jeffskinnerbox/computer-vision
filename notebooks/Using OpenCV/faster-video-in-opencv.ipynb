    "I have you found that working with video file via OpenCV’s `cv2.VideoCapture` can be slow and sluggish.\n",
    "It seem like the `cv2.VideoCapture` and the associated `.read` method to poll another frame from your video file\n",
    "is taking far to long.\n",
    "The problem is likely the video compression and frame decoding.\n",
    "Depending on your video file type, the codecs you have installed, and the physical hardware of your machine,\n",
    "much of your video processing pipeline can actually be consumed by reading and decoding\n",
    "the next frame in the video file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that you’re both reading and decoding the frame in your main processing thread!\n",
    "The `.read`  method is a [blocking operation][01].\n",
    "That is, the main thread of your Python + OpenCV application is entirely blocked\n",
    "(i.e., stalled) until the frame is read from the video file, decoded, and returned to the calling function.\n",
    "By moving these blocking I/O operations to a separate thread and maintaining a queue of decoded frames,\n",
    "your can increase the frame processing rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below show how this latency can be imporved by moving\n",
    "the reading and decoding of video file frames to an entirely separate thread of the program,\n",
    "freeing up our main thread to handle the actual image processing.\n",
