    "Geometric camera calibration, also referred to as camera resectioning,\n",
    "estimates the parameters of a lens and image sensor of an image or video camera.\n",
    "You can use these parameters to correct for the cameras internal characteristics\n",
    "that affect the imaging process, such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Position of image center in the image\n",
    "* Focal length\n",
    "* Different scaling factors for row pixels and column pixels\n",
    "* Skew factor\n",
